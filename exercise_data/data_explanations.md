1 = Mackie Glass chaotic timeseries
2 = Roessler chaotic trajectory (1st parameter set)
3 = Lorenz chaotic trajectory (1st parameter set, dense time sampling)
4 = Roessler chaotic trajectory, low sampling, 2nd parameter set
5 = collection of periodic and quasiperiodic timeseries, most of which are contaminated by noise, and one of which is chaotic (for misdirection)
6 = towel map chaotic trajectory
7 = Non-stationary dynamics of logistic map
8 = oscillatory ARMA, embedded in 4d
9 = 6dimensional Lorenz96 with 2% AR noise - Periodic or Quasiperiodic (don't know!)
10 = 5dimensional Lorenz96 with 2% AR noise - Chaotic trajectory
11 = Hemispherically averaged, monthly averaged, de-seasonalized, reflected shortwave radiation, obtained from CERES data: https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/data/
12 = Experimental timeseries of chaotic electrochemical oscillations from Ref: https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07040
13 = Same as 12 but slightly different experimental conditions
14 = Dataset 93 of https://webdav.tuebingen.mpg.de/cause-effect/ (citation = J. M. Mooij, J. Peters, D. Janzing, J. Zscheischler, B. Schoelkopf:
"Distinguishing cause from effect using observational data: methods and benchmarks"). First column of data is average precipitation over 1948 to 2004 in mm/day, second is average runoff
15 = Same as 14, but dataset 73: first column is CO2 emissions, second column is energy use (kg of oil equivalent)
