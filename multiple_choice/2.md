# Asymptotic (long term) dynamics for 1D continuous systems can be
1. Fixed points
1. Fixed points & divergence to infinity
1. Fixed points & divergence to infinity & periodic
1. Fixed points & divergence to infinity & periodic & chaotic

# Intersections of nullclines are
* Sometimes fixed points
* Always fixed points
* Always fixed points and always stable
* Always fixed points and always unstable

# Quasiperiodic motion is
1. Periodic motion with frequency an irrational number
1. Periodic motion with added noise
1. Approximately periodic motion (e.g. chaotic oscillations with clear main frequency)
1. Motion with many rationally independent periodic components
