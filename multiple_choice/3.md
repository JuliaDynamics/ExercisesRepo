# Why is sensitive dependence not equivalent with deterministic chaos?
1. Linear systems can also have sensitive dependence
1. There needs to be a component that keeps the state bounded
1. Sensitive dependence is part of linearized dynamics, not nonlinear
1. Math doesn't care about the real world finite accuracy

# Which of the following processes describes deterministic chaos on the state space?
1. The swirling of pasta when they are boiling
1. Tossing of fried rice in a wok
1. Kneading dough
1. Making risotto (input, dissipation, mixing)

# A chaotic attractor of a continuous dynamical system has Lyapunov spectrum
1. $$(+, -, -)$$
1. $$(+, 0, -)$$
1. $$(+, +, -)$$
1. $$(0, -, -)$$

# Why can't we just evolve the linearized dynamics (eq. 3.5) to obtain the Lyapunov spectrum?
1. We care about the nonlinear dynamics, not the linear
1. The perturbation vector sizes increase/decrease exponentially and exceed available 64-bit precision
1. The perturbation vectors collapse towards the direction of $$\lambda_1$$ and thus can't provide the remaining spectrum
1. Eqs. 3.5 are numerically unstable and cannot be integrated for long times

# The sum of Lyapunov exponents for a dissipative and a conservative chaotic trajectories are
1. Positive and negative
1. Positive and zero
1. Negative and zero
1. Negative and positive
