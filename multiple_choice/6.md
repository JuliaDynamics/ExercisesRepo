# Why is having single timeseries a problem?
1. Proper timeseries analysis is not typically taught in university
1. Quantities of interest are defined on the state space
1. Same timeseries could be output of several different systems
1. One dimensional dynamical systems cannot be chaotic

# What is the true mathematical goal of an optimal delay embedding?
1. Make set of independent coordinates to express data
1. Maximize fractal dimension of reconstructed set
1. Minimize product d*Ï„ that satisfies $d > 2 D_0(A)$
1. D.E. is an empirical method; it has no mathematical goal
